    'HDX is an Arbitrum token based on the (3,3) Protocol-owned Liquidity model pioneered by OlympusDAO.',
    'HDX rewards are generated by bonding funds to the protocol to provide it further liquidity and by staking to help secure the network. HDX will additionally serve as the meta-token of our Layer 3 DEX, being the end recipient of swaps from trading fees and DeFi services.',
